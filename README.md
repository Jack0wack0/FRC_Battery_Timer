# FRC_Battery_Timer
This is a Python script that reads QR codes and starts timers based on them.

This uses OpenCV, a program used for facial recognition, to detect and decode QR codes.
The program then uses the QR code to start a timer assigned to that specific QR code. 
If the same QR code is scanned again, it ends the timer

This entire time, it is displaying a ranking of which QR code has the highest timer. 
it then updates this in the terminal with a few pretty colors

I made this myself, with a little aid from ChatGPT to figure out some of the logic.

This took me so long to do, so if you enjoy it please let me know! I would love to see people
remix this and create new ways to improve it!

I originally designed this for my FRC team, Obsidian Robotics 5454
